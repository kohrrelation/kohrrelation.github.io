My name is Jonathan Koh and I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern, working in the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science ([IMSV](https://www.imsv.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_koh_jonathan_boon_han/index_eng.html)). My research focus lies in the intersection of extreme-value theory, spatial statistics, statistical learning and environmental statistics. My narrower research focus is on developing statistical tools to model environmental extremes.

I obtained my PhD from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/stat/), under the supervision of [Prof. Anthony Davison](https://people.epfl.ch/anthony.davison?lang=en).
