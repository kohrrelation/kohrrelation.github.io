I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern, working in the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science ([IMSV](https://www.imsv.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_koh_jonathan_boon_han/index_eng.html)) with [Prof. Johanna Ziegel](https://www.imsv.unibe.ch/ueber_uns/personen/prof_dr_ziegel_johanna/index_ger.html). I obtained my PhD in Statistics from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/stat/) in January 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Anthony Davison](https://people.epfl.ch/anthony.davison?lang=en).

I develop new statistical tools to model environmental extremes. My broad research focus lies in the intersection of extreme-value theory, spatial statistics, statistical learning and environmental statistics. For an easy-to-understand, light-hearted and condensed summary of my thesis, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuS3CNJwaM&t).
