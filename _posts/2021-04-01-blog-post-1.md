New website!
======

I defended my PhD in January 2022. Thank you EPFL for an amazing PhD experience and all the memories. Merci et à bientôt, Lausanne! 

I've started a new position as a post-doctoral researcher at the OCCR, University of Bern. What better way to commemorate this with a new website (okay, EPFL kind of disabled my old one so I was pushed to make my own...)

If you're reading this, welcome to my new site! ;)
