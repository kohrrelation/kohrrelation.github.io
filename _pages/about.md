Welcome to my site!  

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern, working in the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science ([IMSV](https://www.imsv.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_koh_jonathan_boon_han/index_eng.html)). I obtained my PhD in Statistics from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/stat/), under the supervision of [Prof. Anthony Davison](https://people.epfl.ch/anthony.davison?lang=en).

My research focus lies in the intersection of extreme-value theory, spatial statistics, statistical learning and environmental statistics. More specifically, I develop new statistical tools to model environmental extremes.
