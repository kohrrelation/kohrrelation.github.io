Update: from February 2025, I will be joining the Seminar for Statistics at ETH as a scientist/lecturer. 

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern, working with [Prof. Johanna Ziegel](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~ziegelj/index.html) in the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science (now with the Seminar for Statistics at ETH) and [Prof. Olivia Martius](https://www.geography.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/prof_dr_romppainen_martius_olivia/index_eng.html) in the Institute of Geography. I obtained my PhD in Statistics from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/stat/) in January 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Anthony Davison](https://people.epfl.ch/anthony.davison?lang=en). For an easy-to-understand, light-hearted and condensed summary of my thesis, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuS3CNJwaM&t).

I develop new statistical tools to model environmental extremes. My broad research focus lies in the intersection of (spatial) extreme-value theory, machine learning, forecast evaluation and environmental statistics.
